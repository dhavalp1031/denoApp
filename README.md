(1) Get the clone of this repository by runnning following GIT command:
```
git clone https://github.com/dhavalp1031/denoApp.git
```

(2) Raw material/Instructional files are stored in assets folder. Content is commented. Please move that folder to the outside of repository folder and uncomment all the content and then activate 'Deno'.

Download and install Deno and run the following command in this directory from the command line of:
```
deno run --allow-net server.ts
```
(Note that you have to be sure to specify `--allow-net` to grant the server network access. This is because Deno is [secure by default](https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/permissions). ðŸ‘Œ)

The server will start on port 8080. If you need to change this (maybe you're running something else on port 8080), you can specify the port:
```
deno run --allow-net server.ts --port=8081
```

(3) Run `ng serve -o` to auto-open Localhost in browser tab OR Run `ng serve` for a dev server and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
